                        <h3>Akan Names</h3>
                        <p>The naming system of the Akan people is as distinct as that which elders in Togo (the Ewe people), the Ga people, Benin (the Fon people), and the African diaspora pass on to toddlers. Other forms of traditional naming include middle names, which can refer to order of birth as part of the caste of siblings, twin status, or could be an inherited maiden name.

                            Aside the fact that day names are a simple means for commonality, they are easy conversation starters and icebreakers.</p>
